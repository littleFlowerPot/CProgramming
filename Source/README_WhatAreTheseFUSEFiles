These .fuse files were created when I did rm .*swp to get rid of the .swp files.
There are now heaps of them, but I can only see and remove two at a time with
ls -la to view, and rm -rf .* to delete.

By the way, it should be noted that the timestamp of these fuse files seem to be around the
time of compilation of the the source files (I compiled with GCC the 0702FunctionsDefn and
the ProjectCopy.c, and a hidden swp file for FunctionsDefn was made.

SOLTUION found: This is to do with vim holding the files in use (somehow, or being referred to) and the files being on a NTFS/NFS files system apparentely.

Use "lsof /path/to/file/ to see what process is holding on to them...and closing vi
removed them straight away without any required command.
